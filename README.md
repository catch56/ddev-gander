## What is Gander?

[Gander](https://www.tag1consulting.com/gander) is a preconfigured Open Telemetry stack relying on Prometheus, Grafana, and Grafana Tempo.

For DDEV v1.23.5 or above run

```sh
ddev add-on get tag1consulting/ddev-gander
```

For earlier versions of DDEV run

```sh
ddev get tag1consulting/ddev-gander
```

Then run Drupal core's OpenTelemetry phpunit tests, and immediately see performance metrics and traces in a Grafana dashboard. Or add PerformanceTestBase coverage to an existing project with a few lines of code if you already have phpunit functional test coverage of your project.

For more information on the phpunit side of things, see [the Drupal core change record](https://www.drupal.org/node/3366904).
